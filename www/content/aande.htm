These services should only be used in an emergency, a critical or life-threatening situation. Play your part by considering one of the other services where possible to allow staff to concentrate on treating patients who are seriously ill or injured.

<p>
999 is the telephone number for emergency medical assistance following a serious accident, illness or injury - for example, in the event of traumatic blood loss, chest pain or loss of consciousness.
