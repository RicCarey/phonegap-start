                             Self-care is the best choice to treat very minor illnesses, ailments and injuries. A range of common illnesses and complaints, such as coughs, colds, sore throats, upset stomachs and aches and pains can be treated with a well stocked medicine cabinet and plenty of rest. Always follow the instructions on the medicine label, and consult your doctor if the illness continues or becomes more severe.
