                           Walk-in centres offer access to a range of treatment for minor illnesses and injuries including, lacerations, stomach upsets, burns and strains. You will be seen by an experienced nurse, without an appointment.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At the NHS Walk-in Centre at London Road, Nottingham, the 8am-8pm Health Centre on Upper Parliament Street and Clifton Nurse Access Point in the Clifton Cornerstone, you can see an experienced nurse for treatment of minor injuries and illnesses.

                        <div class="h2">NHS 111 - when it's less urgent than 999</div>
                        <p>
                        NHS 111 is a new telephone service to make it easier for you to access local health services. If you live in Nottingham City, you can now call 111 when you need help fast, but it isn't a 999 emergency.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        You can ring 111 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to reach a full range of local health services, including out-of-hours doctors, community nurses, emergency dental care and late opening chemists.
                        </p>
111 will get you through to a team of highly-trained advisers, who are supported by experienced nurses. They will assess your symptoms and guide you to the right local service. Wherever possible, the NHS 111 team will transfer you directly to the people you need to speak to.
 </p>
                        <p>
Calls from landlines and mobile phones are free - just like 999.
 </p>
                        <p>
The NHS 111 service is Typetalk friendly (Typetalk is the national telephone relay service for people with communication difficulties) and NHS 111 call advisers have been trained to deal with callers using Typetalk.
 </p>
                        
                        <p>
You should call 111 if:
</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>it's not a 999 emergency; </li>
                            <li>you don't think it can wait for an appointment with your GP; or </li>
                            <li>you don't know who to call for medical help.</li>
                        </ul>
                                                 
                        <p>
For more routine health needs, you should still contact your GP or dentist in the usual way, and for immediate, life-threatening emergencies, continue to call 999. 
  </p>
                        
                        <p>
If you are already receiving healthcare and a health professional has given you a specific telephone number to call when you are concerned about your condition, please continue to use that number.

                        </p>
                         <div class="h2">Dental emergencies</div>
                         <p>
                         If you think you need urgent treatment for a tooth or gum problem and you already have a dentist, you should contact them on their usual number. Out of normal hours in Nottingham please telephone a dedicated NHS Direct number and speak to a dental nurse. This number is 0845 603 1407 and is available for callers at any time.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                        Through this telephone service callers will be assessed to see if they do have an urgent dental need and then directed to an appropriate service. Depending on the process this could either be a specialist out-of-hours dental service or a dental practice.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                        In addition, an emergency dental service is available most days of the week at the Nottingham NHS Walk-in Centre on London Road. Phone NHS Direct on 0845 46 47 or use <a href="http://www.nhs.uk" target="_blank" rel="external" class="externalLink">www.nhs.uk</a> to find the latest opening times.
