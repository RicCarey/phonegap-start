It wasn't me; it was the drink!
</div>
<p>
Many young people utter these words after a night out drinking large amounts of alcohol, carrying on until they vomit, pass out or do something they really regret such as having unprotected sex or being in a situation they can't deal with.

</p>
<p>
Many young people drink because their friends are doing it, but they don't realise the consequences. If things go wrong they could end up with more than a hangover; there is an increased chance that they will catch a sexually transmitted infection such as chlamydia or become pregnant. </p>
<ul>
<li>20% of boys and 13% of girls aged 15-19 say alcohol is the main reason they first had sex* - but you're more likely to regret it if you've been drinking.</li>
<li>40% of young people who have had sex say they haven't used contraception on at least one occasion due to drinking or taking drugs** </li>
<li>A recent survey revealed that 11% of 15-16 year-olds had had unprotected sex while drunk. </li>
<li>Young people who drink are far more likely to compromise their personal safety, walking home alone or trusting others too easily.</li>
</ul>

Why is this important?
</div>
<p>
Sexual health is an important part of physical and mental health. It is a key part of our identity as human beings, together with the fundamental human rights to privacy, a family life and living free from discrimination. Essential elements of good sexual health are fair relationships and sexual fulfillment with access to information and services to avoid the risk of unintended pregnancy, illness or disease. Poor sexual health can have a long lasting and severe impact on people's lives, resulting in:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Pelvic inflammatory disease, which can cause ectopic pregnancies and infertility</li>
<li>STIs and HIV</li>
<li>Cervical and other genital cancers</li>
<li>Hepatitis, chronic liver disease and liver cancer</li>
<li>Bacterial vaginosis and premature delivery</li>
<li>Unintended pregnancies and abortions</li>
<li>Psychological consequences of sexual coercion and abuse</li>
<li>Poor educational, social and economic opportunities for teenage mothers and fathers</li>
</ul>

C-Card Scheme
</div>
<p>
The <a href="http://www.ccardnottingham.co.uk/">C-Card Scheme</a> is a free condom and lubricant distribution service for young people aged 13-24 years living in Nottingham City. There are distribution centres across the city comprising registration and pick-up points. These are based in young people-friendly services such as GP practices, youth clubs, NHS Walk-In Centre and pharmacies. The service is confidential.
 </p>
 <p>
On their first visit a young person must register. They will be given information around safer sex and condom use including how and where to access emergency contraception and information around NHS sexual health services.
 </p>
 <p>
They will then be given a 'C-Card' with a personal number. The card is valid for one year for under 18s or until their 25th birthday for over 18s. When the card expires they will need to re-register.

 </p>
 <p>
After their initial visit they can use the card at any registration or pick-up point to get supplies of condoms and lubricants. Chlamydia screens are also available at several of the sites.
