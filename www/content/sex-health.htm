It wasn't me. It was the drink!
</div>
<p>
Many young people utter these words after a night out drinking large amounts of alcohol, carrying on until they vomit, pass out or do something they really regret such as having unprotected sex or being in a situation they can't deal with.
</p>
<p>
Many young people drink because their friends are doing it, but they don't realise the consequences. If things go wrong they could end up with more than a hangover; there is an increased chance that they will catch a sexually transmitted infection such as Chlamydia or become pregnant.
</p>
<ul>
<li>20% of boys and 13% of girls aged 15-19 say alcohol is the main reason they first had sex* - but you're more likely to regret it if you've been drinking.</li>
<li>40% of young people who have had sex say they haven't used contraception on at least one occasion due to drinking or taking drugs**</li>
<li>A recent survey revealed that 11% of 15-16 year-olds had had unprotected sex while drunk.</li>
<li>Young people who drink are far more likely to compromise their personal safety, walking home alone or trusting others too easily.</li>
</ul>

Why is this important?
</div>
<p>
Sexual health is an important part of physical and mental health. It is a key part of our identity as human beings, together with the fundamental human rights to privacy, a family life and living free from discrimination. Essential elements of good sexual health are fair relationships and sexual fulfillment with access to information and services to avoid the risk of unintended pregnancy, illness or disease. Poor sexual health can have a long lasting and severe impact on people's lives, resulting in:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Pelvic inflammatory disease, which can cause ectopic pregnancies and infertility.</li>
<li>STIs and HIV.</li>
<li>Cervical and other genital cancers.</li>
<li>Hepatitis, chronic liver disease and liver cancer.</li>
<li>Bacterial vaginosis and premature delivery.</li>
<li>Unintended pregnancies and abortions.</li>
<li>Psychological consequences of sexual coercion and abuse.</li>
<li>Poor educational, social and economic opportunities for teenage mothers and fathers.</li>
</ul>

C-Card Scheme 
</div>
<p>
The C-Card Scheme is a free, outreach condom and lubricant distribution service for young people aged 13-24 years living in Nottingham City. There are distribution centres across the city comprising registration and pick-up points. These are based in young people-friendly services such as GP practices, youth clubs, NHS Walk-In Centre, pharmacies and outreach venues. It is a confidential service (confidentiality would be breached only if the young person was at serious risk of harm).
 </p>
 <p>
On their first visit a young person must attend a registration point to gain access to the service. They will be seen by a trained worker who will deliver the registration. This involves giving information around safer sex and condom use, how to put on a condom using a plastic demonstrator, delaying sex, negotiating condom use, sexually transmitted infections and HIV, how and where to access emergency contraception and information around mainstream sexual health services.
 </p>
 <p>
If the young person is under 18 they will be assessed for any child protection issues, e.g. consensual sex, exploitation, age of partner, etc. If the worker is happy that the young person has understood all the information and there are no child protection issues to follow up then they will be given a C-Card with their own personal number on. All under 18s will be given an expiry date of one year from date of registration. When their card has expired they must undergo the registration process again. The cards for 18-24 year olds expire on their 25th birthday.
 </p>
 <p>
After their initial visit they can use their card at any registration or pick up point to get supplies of condoms and lubricants. Pick-up points are for supplies, and only for those already registered onto the scheme. At several of the sites young people can get free chlamydia screens as well.
 </p>
 <p>
Minimal personal details are taken including: date of birth, ethnicity, gender, postcode and sexual orientation. This is to aid the development and expansion of the scheme within areas of highest need, e.g. areas with the highest teenage conception rates, and to ensure the scheme is being accessed by young people who would not ordinarily access mainstream sexual health services, e.g. vulnerable young people, (young offenders or looked after young people) young people from black/ethnic minority groups and young men.
