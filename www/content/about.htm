                           This app is your guide to choosing the right NHS service if you become ill or injured. It will help you find local NHS services, explain what each service does and when it should be used.

                        <p>
                        The Emergency Department is for serious and life threatening conditions: 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Heavy bleeding, broken bones, burns or scalds, chest pain, strokes.
                        </p>
                         <p>
                        Many patients can be treated elsewhere. Play your part by finding the right place for treatment so that Emergency Department staff can concentrate on treating the seriously ill and injured.
