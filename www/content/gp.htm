                           If you have an illness or injury that won’t go away that isn’t life threatening, contact your GP surgery first if possible to make an appointment. They provide a range of services by appointment and when absolutely essential can make home visits.

                           Core opening hours are Mon-Fri 8am-6.30pm. Many GPs now offer extended opening hours including at evenings and weekends. Please contact your practice for details.  If you require a GP outside of normal opening hours please call the GP Out of Hours service.

                           If you need to see a doctor urgently outside opening hours, contact your local surgery. You will be redirected to the Out of Hours service. If you are not registered with a GP then please phone NHS Direct on 0845 46 47. If you need to be seen, you will be given an appointment at a base of your choice.

                         <p>
                            Please ensure that you request repeat prescriptions from your GP in plenty of time so you do not run out of your essential medication. The emergency department and walk-in centres should not be used for this.
