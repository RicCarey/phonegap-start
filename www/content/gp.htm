                         If you have an illness or injury that won't go away but that isn't life threatening, contact your GP surgery first if possible to make an appointment. They provide a range of services by appointment and when absolutely essential can make home visits. 
                            </p>
                        <p>
Core opening hours are Mon-Fri 8am-6.30pm. Many GPs now offer extended opening hours including evenings and weekends. Please contact your practice for details. 
                             </p>
                        <p>
If you need to see a doctor urgently outside opening hours, contact your local surgery. You will be redirected to the Out of Hours service. If you are not registered with a GP then please phone NHS Direct on <a href="tel:08454647">0845 46 47</a>. If you need to be seen, you will be given an appointment at a base of your choice.
                             </p>
                        <p>
Please note: Deaf patients who require urgent medical care should contact the emergency GP out-of-hours service by using the NHS Direct Minicom number <a href="tel:08456064647">0845 606 4647</a>.

 <div class="h2">How to register with a GP</div>
                        <p>
                            To register with a GP practice you need to live within their practice boundary and they must be willing to accept you. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
Everyone living permanently in Great Britain has a right to be registered with and receive services from a GP. Some practices may not be able to take on new patients if they are already at capacity.
</p>
                        <p>
If your local practice is able to accept new patients, you should take your medical card to the surgery and tell the receptionist you wish to register. If you do not have a medical card, you will need to fill in a form to trace your medical records. For advice on registering with a local GP practice, contact the Patient Advice and Liaison Service on <a href="tel:08001830456">0800 183 0456</a> or email <a href="mailto:pals@nottinghamcity.nhs.uk">pals@nottinghamcity.nhs.uk</a>.
 </p>
                        <p>
You have the right to register with a new GP practice at any time and you do not need to tell your current practice. Your GP practice also has the right to remove you from its list but they would normally give you eight days' notice to find another practice and during this time they are still responsible for your care. However, this only happens in exceptional circumstances.

 <div class="h2">Repeat prescriptions</div>
                        <p>
Please ensure that you request repeat prescriptions from your GP in plenty of time so  you do not run out of your essential medication. The emergency department and walk-in centres should not be used to obtain repeat prescriptions&hellip;
