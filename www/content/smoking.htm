                        Stopping smoking is the single biggest step towards dramatically improving health and life expectancy. Evidence suggests that smokers are four times more likely to stop for good if they have the right support from a local NHS Stop Smoking service.

                        <p>

                        We strive to make the service accessible and appropriate for as many people as possible. Giving up smoking may be especially difficult for those with special needs and so specialist advisors work with people with mental health or learning difficulties, and with people in hospitals, day centres and prisons. Our aim is to offer a flexible approach to delivering a service to those with special requirements.

                        Risks of smoking
                         </div>
                        <p>
                        The risks of smoking to health are well-publicised, with 22% of all male deaths and 11% of all female deaths being smoking-related. Giving up smoking can reduce the risk of developing many smoking related illnesses such as lung cancer and heart disease.  Within 10 to15 years of giving up, an ex-smokers' risk of developing lung cancer is only slightly greater than someone who has never smoked.

                        Benefits of giving up
                        </div>
                        <p>
                        The benefits to health of giving up smoking include being able to breathe more easily, reduction in the risk of serious disease, improvement in circulation and increased fertility.
                         </p>
                        <p>
                        Breathing in second hand smoke has also been proven to pose health risks for non-smokers.  By reducing smoking in the home and many public places these risks can be reduced.  Smoke-free environments help reduce the risk of serious disease to everyone and smoke free homes can reduce illnesses in children such as pneumonia, bronchitis, wheezing and asthma.
